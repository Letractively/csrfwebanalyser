-You need libcurl, libxml and libpcre to compile

-Edit the include and load paths in the Makefile, if you compile and install to other path than 
your system's default, you'll probably need to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable to check your 
library directories.

-if you plan to use the crawler with threads, you need to build libcurl with c-ares.  If your
system does not provide c-ares, built it from sources and configure curl with --configure 
--enable-ares=<full path to c-ares installation>
