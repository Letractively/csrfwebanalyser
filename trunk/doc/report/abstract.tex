\section{Abstract}
\paragraph
In this report we briefly explain how Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), a common exploit used to attack websites,
works.  In addition, We present the most well known defenses against this attack and explain how each one works.
We conducted an analysis on the top 100,000 web sites, as rated by alexa.com, as to which defense they implement
to counter any CSRF attacks and present the results.  To meet this end we implemented a tool that crawls the 
web, parses http headers and html body of each site to deduct which defense is employed.
